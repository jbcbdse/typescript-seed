This is a barebones setup for a running application with Typescript and Node.

Features:

- node version specified in .nvmrc
- Typescript installed as dev dependency
- `yarn watch` configured with nodemon and ts-node
- `yarn watch:debug` configured with `--inspect-brk` flag
- tsconfig with sensible defaults
- eslint with typescript and prettier plugins with recommended defaults
- jest configured for unit testing with sensible defaults
- This README

## Using this seed

Fork this repo and start coding adding code to the `src/` directory.

## Developing

Do initial package install with `yarn`

Develop and test the running application with `yarn watch` or `yarn watch:debug`

Run unit tests with `yarn test` or run in watch mode with `yarn tdd`

## Run your application

Build the app first with `yarn build`

Run the app with `npm start`

## Contributing

Feel free to add more sensible defaults for a basic node application.
